# ArkVertex

**A code-first parametric 3D platform — like Tailwind for 3D.**

ArkVertex is a **developer-first 3D engine** designed to build **parametric, component-based web applications**. It provides a large collection of **assets, primitives, and reusable components**, along with **CAD-style utilities** like CSG and BREP operations.  

Developers can use ArkVertex to create **lightweight CAD-like apps, games, interactive visualizations, or custom 3D tools**, all directly in the browser. Assets can be anything from **swords and furniture to building concepts**, making it a versatile platform for **parametric, web-native 3D development**.

## Key Features

* **Parametric primitives and components**  
  Create objects like `new Sword(length, width, curve)`, `new Wall(height, width, material)`, or custom parametric shapes.

* **Large asset library**  
  Ready-to-use 3D shapes, building concepts, game props, and interactive components for fast development.

* **CAD-style utilities**  
  Support for CSG, BREP, and parametric operations for building app logic and workflows.

* **Code-based shaders and animations**  
  Define interactivity, visual effects, and procedural animations entirely through code.

* **Web-native and lightweight**  
  Optimized for browser performance and modern JavaScript workflows.

* **Extensible and modular**  
  Add new primitives, components, or utilities as your application grows.

## Vision

ArkVertex is a **base engine for 3D applications on the web**, enabling developers to:

* Build **parametric CAD-like apps**  
* Create **games, interactive visualizations, or product configurators**  
* Use a **rich library of reusable 3D components and assets**  
* Implement **lightweight web-native 3D experiences**  
* Rapidly prototype **custom workflows and interactive 3D tools**

It is **not a full CAD or BIM kernel**, but it provides the **building blocks for versatile parametric 3D applications entirely in code**.

## Status

ArkVertex is **early-stage and under active development**.  

Tooling, modules, and example apps will be gradually released for early access.
