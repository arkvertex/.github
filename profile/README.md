# ArkVertex
**A BIM/FEM engine on Babylon.js — like Tailwind for building information and finite element modeling.**

ArkVertex is a **developer-first 3D BIM/FEM engine** built directly on **Babylon.js**, designed to enable rapid development of **custom parametric BIM and FEM software** entirely in the browser.

It provides powerful **parametric primitives, reusable components**, and essential **CAD/BIM utilities** like CSG, BREP operations, full **IFC** and **DXF** import/export support, plus lightweight FEM analysis building blocks.

Developers and teams use ArkVertex to create **custom BIM viewers**, **product configurators**, **structural analysis tools**, **facility management apps**, **digital twins**, or specialized **FEM simulation interfaces** — all web-native, performant, and extensible.

Assets range from parametric building elements and structural components to full IFC/DXF-derived models, making it ideal for AEC (Architecture, Engineering, Construction) workflows.

## Key Features
* **Parametric BIM/FEM primitives and components**  
  Create objects like `new Beam(length, section, material)`, `new Slab(thickness, reinforcement, span)`, `new Wall(height, layers, insulation)`, or fully custom parametric entities with IFC/DXF compatibility.

* **Full IFC & DXF support**  
  Native import, parsing, export, and manipulation of **IFC** (Industry Foundation Classes) and **DXF** files — read geometry, properties, hierarchies, and metadata directly in the browser.

* **CAD/BIM-style utilities**  
  Built-in CSG, BREP, boolean operations, parametric sweeps/extrusions, clash detection basics, and lightweight FEM mesh generation for structural simulations.

* **Built on Babylon.js**  
  Leverages Babylon.js for high-performance WebGL/WebGPU rendering, PBR materials, real-time interactivity, animations, and cross-browser compatibility.

* **Code-based materials, shaders, and analysis**  
  Define custom shaders, procedural textures, structural visualizations, load diagrams, or simulation results entirely through JavaScript/TypeScript.

* **Web-native and lightweight**  
  Optimized for browser performance — no heavy plugins, runs on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices with modern JavaScript workflows.

* **Extensible and modular**  
  Easily extend with new primitives, IFC property sets, FEM solvers, or domain-specific tools as your custom software grows.

## Vision
ArkVertex is the **foundation for custom BIM/FEM applications on the web**, empowering developers and companies to:
* Build **specialized parametric BIM tools** (viewers, editors, checkers)
* Develop **custom FEM analysis interfaces** for structural, thermal, or acoustic simulations
* Create **web-based digital twins**, facility management, or asset tracking systems
* Rapidly prototype and deploy **industry-specific 3D AEC/FEM software**
* Deliver **IFC/DXF-native experiences** without conversion pipelines

It is **not a complete off-the-shelf BIM/FEM suite** like Revit or ANSYS, but the **open, code-first building blocks** to create tailored, high-performance parametric 3D software entirely in the browser.

## Status
ArkVertex is **early-stage and under active development**.

Core Babylon.js integration, IFC/DXF loaders, parametric BIM primitives, and example custom apps will be gradually released for early access.
