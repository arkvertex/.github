# ArkVertex

**A code-first 3D AI platform — coming soon.**

ArkVertex is an upcoming platform focused on building **lightweight, high-performance 3D experiences** directly through code — optimized for the web and modern JavaScript workflows.

Instead of heavy 3D files and complex pipelines, ArkVertex focuses on **basic geometric, parametric assets** designed to be lightweight, fast, and browser-native.

## The Vision

* Code-first creation of 3D assets
* Native web performance with minimal overhead
* A future-facing approach to interactive and AI-driven 3D
* Designed for developers, not pipelines

---

## Status

ArkVertex is **early-stage and under active development**.

Details, tooling, and capabilities are intentionally being revealed gradually.

Early access and previews will be announced.
