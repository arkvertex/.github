# ArkVertex — AI-Powered 3D Creation for Everyone on the Web.  
**Tagline:**  
**“The AI 3D platform that makes the web feel alive.”**

---

## Overview and Goal  
ArkVertex is a **3D AI platform for the web**, focused on providing design tools, AI-driven code, and no-code creation workflows to enhance 3D experiences with **superior performance**.  
It serves **developers, designers, and non-technical users**, enabling the creation of interactive, parametric 3D assets and companions built from:

- Primitives (boxes, cylinders, spheres, toruses)  
- CSG booleans  
- Extrusions and lathes  
- Handlers and rounded edges  
- Perfect LODs

The platform emphasizes **pure code-driven geometry** that loads in **<50 kb** and runs at **120 fps**, even on phones—no imported low-poly blobs or heavy GLB files.  
All products share one unified geometry engine based on **primitives**, **CSG operations**, and **procedural effects**, ensuring consistency, editability, and real-time performance.

### ArkVertex solves key challenges:
- **For non-technical users:** Easily add interactive 3D companions to websites without coding.  
- **For developers and designers:** Create performant, ready-to-use 3D assets for games, websites, and tools with runtime generation and built-in effects.

---

## Core Philosophy  
Everything is built from **parametric primitives and operations**, ensuring:

- **100% geometric and editable:** Assets are generated from code for instant customization.  
- **High performance:** Ultra-light bundles (**<100 kb**) for fast loading and smooth rendering.  
- **AI integration:** Link designs to AI-driven behaviors, animations, and interactions.  
- **Versatility:** Export to **Three.js** or **Babylon.js** for seamless integration.

No heavy dependencies—just **pure, alive geometry** that feels interactive and responsive.

## Products  

---

### **Phase 1: EmbedRobot (Quick Entry for Non-Technicals)**  
A **no-code platform** to design and embed a simple, cute 3D robot on your website.

**Design Process:**  
Use primitives and CSG to create a robot that matches your brand (colors, shapes, style).

**Embedding:**  
Copy-paste **one line of code** to add it to your site.

**AI Features:**  
Purchase an AI key to enable chatting.  
The robot can talk to visitors about your services, products, or website content, performing actions like animations (e.g., drooping eyes, color shifts).

**Exports:**  
Bundles to **Three.js** for fast loading (**<100 kb**).

**Problem Solved:**  
Non-technical site owners can make their websites interactive with a companion that **explains the site**, **engages visitors**, and **boosts retention**—no custom code required.

---

### **Phase 2: Design Tool for Assets (For Coders and Non-Coders)**  
A full design engine for creating 3D assets, companions, and environments.

**Design Process:**  
Build assets (e.g., swords, creatures, sculptures) using primitives, CSG, and effects.  
Free to design and download.  
AI-generated designs (e.g., “flying robot with tentacles”) require payment.

**Libraries Included:**  
Two open-source libraries:  
- One for **Three.js**  
- One for **Babylon.js**  
These read ArkVertex designs and render them at runtime via npm/CDN imports.

**Features:**  
- Stack operations in a **node-like tree**  
- Drag sliders for parameters (round radius, segments, taper, twist)  
- Live-preview LODs  
- Save reusable **species**  
- Link AI actions (laugh, jump, glow) to animations or custom JS functions

**Problems Solved:**  
- **Performance:** Pure runtime-generated geometry—no GLTF or mesh files needed.  
- **Ease of Use:** Exports ready-to-use meshes with pre-applied effects, glow, and behaviors.  
Perfect for **web games**, **websites**, or **3D tools**.

**Monetization:**  
Free core tool; paid API keys for AI features and advanced integrations.

---

### **Phase 3: Community Marketplace**  
A marketplace where users share and sell creature templates, assets, and **species packs**.

**Features:**  
- Browse, buy, and sell parametric designs  
- Platform takes a cut on each sale

**Integration:**  
All items use the same geometry engine, ensuring cross-compatibility.

**Goal:**  
Foster a community for **remixing**, **monetizing**, and **sharing** 3D creations with ongoing revenue from transactions.

Future products will expand on this foundation, but these form the core platform today—unified under a single dashboard and subscription model.
